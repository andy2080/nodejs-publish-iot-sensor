nodejs iot sensor app project

# Basic Internet of Things Sensor Application

This application is derived from iot project on the book. The initial project has multiple scenarios in it, so I thought categorized as partial projects based on scenarios seemed good idea.

## README version 0.1.0

Basic IoT (Internet of Things) application which specifies and collects sensor datum around the device. The device variation could be differed and switched by developer or user. By default, Beaglebone black is used to perform collecting sensor data. This repository only deals with sensor application, however, this application could be expanded and merged with other IoT application of the author, such as IoT Streamer application, IoT Configuration application, and so forth.

IoT Sensor application is divided into few features as the following : 

* *Sensor data collection* : The most fundamental feature, which is to get sensor data. Sensor attributes can be differed by devices' sensor. Sensors should be detectable from the low-level linux. Later, recently attached sensors may automatically detectable and realized by system.
* *Sensor data distribution* : 
* *Sensor Status Configuration* :
* *Sensor device Management* :
